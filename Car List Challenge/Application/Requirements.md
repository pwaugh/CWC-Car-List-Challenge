## General Requirments: 

* Use a git repo and share it as we want to see your commits

* Please accomplish as many levels as you are comfortable with. You should only proceed to the next level if the current level has already been completely implemented.
* Do not show any part of the UI if it’s not working. Let’s focus on quality over quantity!

## Level 1 Requirements - Gold Badge

### Show a simple list of collapsed items or cards
* Extract the list information from the join JSON file, or you can come up with your own assets

## Level 2 Requirements - Platinum Badge

### Add or implement the expandable card to the list
* By default, the first item should be expanded
* Upon clicking or tapping an item, the previous item will collapse, and the new item will expand.
* Pros and cons sections should be shown.
* Note that there is no limit to the number of bullet points inside the card so these should be added and scaled dynamically.

## Level 3 Requirements - Diamond Badge

### Implement the filters
* Add a filter section in the UI, such as:  Vehicle make & Vehicle model
* You can create the two filters list from the JSON provided or come up with your own
